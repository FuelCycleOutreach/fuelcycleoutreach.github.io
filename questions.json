Countries may choose to hold themselves to standards beyond those set by the international community, but they arbitrate a baseline; helping states that do not possess the infrastructure to verify their standards are being met. If a dispute arises it would typically be addressed through diplomatic means, consultation, and referred to the United Nations Security Council if those steps fail.",

Civilians have complementary roles in this whole process by checking that the transparency and trust- building efforts continue. In states, like Sweden and South Korea, with burgeoning nuclear projects, their regional initiatives to bring in affected community members are vital to their repository siting efforts. This continued engagement with the public is crucial for continued trust, especially as technologies evolve. Establishing the validation behind new technologies is only possible through these regional campaigns"
