              "Nuclear safeguards are measures implemented to ensure that nuclear materials are used for peaceful purposes and not diverted for the development of nuclear weapons. They achieve this goal by monitoring and controlling the use of nuclear materials. Nuclear safeguards were first introduced with the creation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1957. It conducts inspections and verifies compliance with safeguards agreements, and supports states that are building facilities to meet its standards.",
              "Starting with the Atoms for Peace speech in 1953, the international community has developed a series of systems (safeguards) to allow for the peaceful use of nuclear energy with less threat of spreading or proliferating nuclear weapons.",

Countries are required to declare their nuclear activities, and inspectors perform unannounced visits to nuclear facilities to ensure compliance. Non-compliance can lead to diplomatic consequences, sanctions, and, in severe cases, referral to the United Nations Security Council for further action."

              "The purpose of nuclear safeguards dialogue is to facilitate communication and cooperation between countries, international organizations, and the IAEA to ensure the effective implementation of safeguards. Public perception has evolved from initial skepticism to recognition of the crucial role nuclear safeguards play in promoting international security and preventing nuclear proliferation. Their participation is informed by secondary sources of information, which states share through diplomatic channels, formal agreements, regular meetings, and reporting mechanisms established between countries and the IAEA. Technology sharing agreements like the United States (U.S.) 123 Agreements exist in addition to the IAEA forums, as defined relationships between states in what I would argue is a form of dialogue.",

              "Dialogue contributes to transparency by encouraging open communication about nuclear activities, sharing information about safeguards implementation, and fostering trust among participating nations.",
              "As an extension of the United Nations, the IAEA plays a central and neutral role in facilitating dialogue, providing technical expertise, conducting inspections, and verifying compliance with safeguards agreements. Countries may choose to hold themselves to standards beyond those set by the international community, but they arbitrate a baseline; helping states that do not possess the infrastructure to verify their standards are being met. If a dispute arises it would typically be addressed through diplomatic means, consultation, and referred to the United Nations Security Council if those steps fail.",
              "Dialogue happens when states establish transparent frameworks, joint campaigns to inform the public, and the establishment of trust-building mechanisms to enhance confidence among participating nations. Civilians have complementary roles in this whole process by checking that the transparency and trust- building efforts continue. In states, like Sweden and South Korea, with burgeoning nuclear projects, their regional initiatives to bring in affected community members are vital to their repository siting efforts. This continued engagement with the public is crucial for continued trust, especially as technologies evolve. Establishing the validation behind new technologies is only possible through these regional campaigns"

The end of the Cold War led to increased cooperation between nuclear-armed states and contributed to efforts to enhance nuclear transparency and reduce global nuclear arsenals. The Regional Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, established in various parts of the world, contributed to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, complementing global nuclear safeguards. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed in 2015, aimed to address concerns about Iran’s nuclear program by imposing restrictions and enhanced monitoring, showcasing international efforts to strengthen nuclear safeguards."
